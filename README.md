# 🎨 HTML Canvas Playground

This is a repository of small projects that I built to learn **HTML Canvas**. Each project explores different Canvas API features — from animations and particle systems to interactive games and audio visualizations.

## 📁 Projects

| # | Project | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Flower Petal** | Generates beautiful flower petal patterns using mathematical curves on canvas |
| 2 | **Fractals type** | Renders fractal patterns and self-similar geometric structures |
| 3 | **Image Animation When Mouse Move** | Animates image elements that respond to mouse movement |
| 4 | **Interacting Particles** | A particle system where particles interact and connect with each other |
| 5 | **Music Visualizer** | Visualizes audio/music as dynamic graphics on canvas |
| 6 | **Text Animation** | Animates text characters with creative canvas effects |
| 7 | **Tic Tac Toe** | A classic Tic Tac Toe game built entirely on HTML Canvas |
| 8 | **Visualizer** | An advanced audio visualizer with multiple visual assets |
| 9 | **Delta Modulation** | Visualizes the delta modulation signal processing technique |
| 10 | **Epicycle 1** | Draws complex patterns using rotating circles (Fourier epicycles) |
| 11 | **Epicycle 2** | An extended version of the epicycle drawing project |
| 12 | **Glowing Balls** | Renders glowing ball animations with light effects |
| 13 | **Moving Ball with Keyboard** | A ball that can be controlled using keyboard input |
| 14 | **Place Ball** | Click to place balls on the canvas and watch them interact |
